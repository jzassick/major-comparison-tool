# major-comparison-tool
A web tool designed to let prospective students compare majors side by side.

So far I just set up a basic MERN app as a template to build off of
this handles setting up the server, db, and react app with some basic components

make sure you have node/npm installed

HOW TO RUN APP:
go to /server and run 'node server.js' to run server
go to /client and run 'npm start' to run the app

NOTE: you need to update mongodb info in server/config.env to actually connect
